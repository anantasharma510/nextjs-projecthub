# Next.js Project Hub

Welcome to the **Next.js Project Hub**! This repository is designed to host multiple projects built with **Next.js**, making it easy to manage and organize different applications. Some example applications include:

- **LMS** (Learning Management System)
- **HMS** (Hospital Management System)
- And more...

Each application is available under its own route.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow the steps below:

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/anantasharma510/nextjs-projecthub.git
cd nextjs-projecthub
npm install
Run the Development Server
Once the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed, run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Now, open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app locally.

If you add a new project (e.g., Blog), access it at http://localhost:3000/blogs.
Add New Projects
To add a new project (like LMS, HMS, etc.), follow these steps:

Frontend (UI):
Inside the src/app/ directory, create a new folder for your project. For example, for a Blog app, create the blogs folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
src/app/blogs/
Inside this folder, implement the frontend of your project. This typically includes:

page.js
layout.js
Other components and pages specific to your project.
Backend (API):
If your project requires backend functionality, create an API route under the src/app/api/ directory. For example, for the Blog app, create the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
src/app/api/blogs/
Inside this folder, implement backend code like:

API routes
Database interactions
Server-side logic
This approach ensures that frontend and backend code are organized in separate directories for each project.

Running the Development Server
To run the app locally:

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app in action.

For any additional projects, you can access them via their specified routes. For example, a Blog app would be accessible at http://localhost:3000/blogs.
Deploying to Vercel
To deploy your project to Vercel:

Push your changes to GitHub.
Visit Vercel and sign in with your GitHub account.
Create a new project on Vercel and connect it to your GitHub repository.
Vercel will automatically deploy your app. Any changes pushed to the repository will trigger automatic deployments.
