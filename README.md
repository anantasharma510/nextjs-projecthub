# Next.js Project Hub

Welcome to the **Next.js Project Hub**, a comprehensive repository designed to host multiple projects built with **Next.js**. This hub allows for easy management and organization of various applications, such as **LMS** (Learning Management System), **HMS** (Hospital Management System), and more, each available under its own route.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment and begin contributing to this repository.

### Clone the Repository

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anantasharma510/nextjs-projecthub.git
   cd nextjs-projecthub
   npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Access the app locally at http://localhost:3000.

If you've added a specific project (e.g., Blog), you can access it at http://localhost:3000/blogs.

Add New Projects
To add a new project, such as LMS or HMS, follow these steps:

Frontend (UI):
Create a new folder for your project inside the src/app/ directory. For example, for a Blog app, create the blogs folder inside src/app/:

bash
Copy
Edit
src/app/blogs/
Inside this folder, design and implement the frontend of your project. This includes creating necessary components, layouts, and pages like page.js, layout.js, etc. All frontend code related to the specific project should reside within this folder.

Backend (API):
If your project requires backend functionality (such as database interactions), create an API route inside the src/app/api/ directory. For a Blog app, you would create the src/app/api/blogs/ folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
src/app/api/blogs/
Inside this folder, implement all backend-related code, such as API routes, handlers, and database operations. This separation ensures that frontend and backend code for each project remains well-organized.

By structuring your projects this way, you maintain a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to scale and manage each application individually.

Running the Development Server
To run the app locally:

Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app in action.

If you've created additional projects (e.g., a Blog), you can access them by visiting http://localhost:3000/blogs or another specified route.

Deploying to Vercel
To deploy the project to Vercel:

Push your changes to your GitHub repository.
Visit Vercel and sign in with your GitHub account.
Create a new project on Vercel and connect it to your GitHub repository.
Vercel will automatically deploy your app. Any changes pushed to the repository will trigger automatic deployments.
